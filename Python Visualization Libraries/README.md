Comparison of different Python Visualization Libraries such as: Matplotlib, Pyplot, Celluloid, Bokeh, and nbinteract. If you are interested in a more in depth explanation about these libraries, check out my Python Data Visualization Libraries post in my [Personal Blog website](https://pierpaolo28.github.io/blog/). <br>

Some examples of online Data Visualization created in this exercise are also available on my Personal WebSite at [this link.](https://pierpaolo28.github.io/Projects/project11.html)
